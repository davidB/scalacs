ScalaCS
=======
 !! NOT YET RELEASED !!

The firsts goals of ScalaCS are :
* to provide a resident compiler server for several projects (=> decrease time need to re-compile from command line tool)
* to ease integration into tools (text editor, IDE)
  * by using an http interface to access services provided by the server to ease integration, see sample clients
    * sample shell script, used curl scalacs.sh (could be adapted easily to Windows, Emacs and any Text editor who allow running external tools)
    * sample java client (to copy/paste/adapte) at src/test/java/net_alchim31_scalacs_client/BasicHttpScalacsClient.java
  * by providing formatted ouput log (and regexp to parse +/-)

Why name it ScalaCS ?
ScalaCS is short of scala-compiler-server (but I hope to support other tool in the future (an not only compiler) like code analyzer,...)

(usable in open-source and commercial product)

Installation
------------

copy the latest jar (scalacs-X.Y-withDeps) from oss.sonatype.org :
* [release](http://oss.sonatype.org/github-releases/net/alchim31/scalacs)
* [snapshot / wip](http://oss.sonatype.org/github-snapshots/net/alchim31/scalacs)

Server startup
--------------

>  java -jar target/scalacs-0.1-withDeps_sc2.7.7.jar

Or use scalacs-0.1.jar + dependencies (listed into pom.xml) from a maven repository.

HTTP Interface
--------------

Some basic client samples are provided
* shell script : scalacs.sh (use [cUrl]() to do http request and tr to restore multiline message)
* java class : src/test/java/net_alchim31_scalacs_client/BasicHttpScalacsClient.java

But best is to call http directly from the editor/IDE you used.
 
h3. output format

The output of command that return with HTTP status OK (200) should follow the format readable with regexp :
<pre>
<code>
^-(INFO|WARN|ERROR)\t([^\t]*)\t([^\t]*)\t(.*)$
</code>
</pre>
* group 1 : Level of the message
* group 2 : category of the message
* group 3 : source localisation iff not empty use the following regexp to parse :
  <pre>
  <code>
([^#]*)#(\d+),(\d+),(\d+),(\d+)
  </code>
  </pre>
  * group 3.1 : absolute path of the file
  * group 3.2 : start line
  * group 3.3 : start column
  * group 3.4 : start charactere offset in the file (some editor/IDE prefer offset to line/column)
  * group 3.5 : length in character
* group 4 : the message with '\n' replaced by 'ยง' (there is no '\r' into the message), so replace 'ยง' by your line feef to have the message on several lines ('\t' are allowed).

h3. help, usage

simply call http://127.0.0.1:27616/

Note : multi line message use the character *ยง* in place of *\n* so editor could grab the full message in on-line (regexp)

h3. createOrUpdate

Request to createOrUpdate one or more project define in the Yaml syntax, each project definition should be separated by "---"
Project definition should by send as content of the HTTP POST to : http://127.0.0.1:27616/createOrUpdate
Fields :
* name : name of the project, used as a key
* sourceDirs : list of directory with source files to compile
* includes : filter to select file to compile into sourceDirs(optional)
* excludes : filter to select file to not compile into sourceDirs(optional)
* targetDir : place where to put generated .class
* classpath : list of path (directory/jar) needed to compile files from sourceDirs
* exported : the path of the jar/directory used by other project to reference the current project (optional)
* args : list of additional args to pass to the scalac compiler, could be ignored (depends of the backend)! (optional)

Sample :
<pre>
<code>
  name : sample
  sourceDirs :
    - "/home/dwayne/work/oss/scalacs/src/main/scala"
  includes :
    - "*.scala"
  excludes :
  targetDir : "/home/dwayne/work/oss/scalacs/target/classes"
  classpath :
    - "/home/dwayne/.m2/repository/org/scala-lang/scala-library/2.7.5/scala-library-2.7.5.jar"
    - "/home/dwayne/.m2/repository/org/scala-lang/scala-compiler/2.7.5/scala-compiler-2.7.5.jar"
    - "/home/dwayne/.m2/repository/org/jboss/netty/netty/3.1.0.GA/netty-3.1.0.GA.jar"
    - "/home/dwayne/.m2/repository/SnakeYAML/SnakeYAML/1.3/SnakeYAML-1.3.jar"
  exported : ""
  args :
    - "-deprecation"
</code>
</pre>

h3. compile

Request to compile modified projects.
HTTP GET to : http://127.0.0.1:27616/compile

h3. cleanCompiler

Request to clean compiler (cache).
HTTP GET to : http://127.0.0.1:27616/cleanCompiler


Notes
-----

Use 2 separated projects for 'main' and 'test' part, where test has got main into its classpath.

TODO
----

* --deploy scalacs into central repository--, not possible because scalacs depends of artifact from jboss (netty) and from scala-tools.org (scala-library, scala-compiler,...)
* document output format
* integrate sbt, ConditionalCompilation (to avoid recompile all)
* integrate xsbt launcher as bootstrap
* provide support/version for several scala's version
* do automatic cleanCompiler when dependency jar are modified
* document output/log
* integrate sts into maven-scala-plugin and YaScalaDT

Thanks
------

to read me to end, and feedbacks are welcome !
